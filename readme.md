# CPlantBox Visualization Tool

## Introduction

The CPlantBox Visualization Tool is a web-based application designed for the visualization of plant growth simulations. It is part of Xiaoran Zhou's PhD thesis and is hosted at [xrzhou.com/cpb](http://xrzhou.com/cpb).

## Features

- Interactive simulation of plant growth with a variety of plant parameters.
- Ability to select or upload parameters for simulation.
- Parameter editor for detailed control over simulation inputs.
- Simulation time input for controlling the duration of the simulation.
- Rotation control to view the plant model from different angles.
- Downloadable VTP (Visualization Toolkit Polygon) output of the plant model.
- Guided tour for new users to learn how to use the tool.

## Usage

To use the tool, follow these steps:

1. Visit the hosted page at [xrzhou.com/cpb](http://xrzhou.com/cpb).
2. Choose from a list of clickable plant parameter options or upload your own.
3. Input the desired simulation time.
4. Use the rotation control to view the plant model from different angles.
5. Click the simulation button to start the simulation.
6. Download the VTP file of the plant model after simulation.

## Technical Details

The tool is implemented in JavaScript and WebAssembly, compiled from the wasm branch of the CPlantBox GitHub repository.

## Browser Compatibility

The tool is optimized for Chrome, Edge, Opera, or Safari. Firefox users may experience limited functionality.
